# Machine Learning with scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn

I signed up for the [Machine Learning Foundations class offered October 2015 through Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/) but was disappointed to discover that all the lectures involved [GraphLab Create](https://dato.com/products/create/) which is an expensive proprietary machine learning framework instead of the popular (and free) tools that are widely available such as the excellent [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) ML framework or [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). 

After following along with the lectures I discovered much of what you can do with GraphLab Create can be done with the free and open source tools instead (with slight differences). After many hours of reading over the scikit-learn documentation, Googling, and plenty of trial and error I decided to make some iPython notebooks to serve as a reference for myself in the future as well as others who may be interested.

Any feedback is welcome. I am learning this as we go along!

Note that no homework solutions will be posted here in accordance with the Coursera Honor Code. Just the examples we've gone over in class.
